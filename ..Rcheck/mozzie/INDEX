find_mate               Finds a mate for a female mosquitoes of
                        breeding age.
hello                   Hello, World!
init_juv_stage          Roughly determines the stage of a juvenile
                        clutch given numerical 'age'. Needs checking
                        with literature, or replace with better method.
init_position           Generates random 'starting' positions for adult
                        agents. Uses boundary data for simulation
                        region. Draws a polygon from the boundary
                        points given in boundaryDat and picks N
                        randomly spaced points within it. Includes a
                        boundary check: will keep drawing points until
                        there are N in the region/polygon. Requires
                        package 'sp' for Polygon object.
initialise_adults       Creates an initial data.table of adult agents.
                        Since this is an initial spread, some data is
                        made up/dummy: for example, we don't know the
                        ID of the parents. Latitude/Longitude of agents
                        is randomly determined through another function
                        'init_position' and added to the data.table
                        after construction.
initialise_eggs         Creates a data.table of newly laid eggs to add
                        to the juvenile data.table.
initialise_juveniles    Creates an initial data.table of juvenile
                        agents. Since this is an initial spread, some
                        data is made up/dummy: for example, we don't
                        know the ID of the parents. Latitude/Longitude
                        of agents is randomly determined and added to
                        the data.table after construction.
initialise_release      Simulates a release of Wolbachia-carrying
                        mosquitoes. Releases in this experiment are
                        always adults. Much of this is functionally
                        similar to initialise_adults. Since this is a
                        release, some data is made up/dummy: for
                        example, we don't know the ID of the parents.
                        Latitude/Longitude of agents is given by data
                        supplied by the WMP.
initialize_enzyme       Initialises the Enzyme Kinetic model lookup
                        table for the model run. The EKM is how we
                        dictate the development rate of agents. The EKM
                        model is the same one used in Focks 1993. Input
                        data is in CELSIUS, EKM works with KELVIN.
juv_emergence           Runs the 'juvenile emergence' step. Determines
                        which juvenile agents are to age into adult
                        agents, and calls 'juv_to_adult' on them.
                        IMPORTANT: this should update 'mozzie.dt' and
                        'juv.dt' on a global scale.
juv_stage_update        Determines the juvenile agents that develop
                        into the next stage, and updates the
                        development stage of these juveniles. Once
                        'enzyme' exceeds 0.95, a juvenile agent
                        develops to the next stage. Recall that Stage
                        1: egg, 2: larvae, 3: pupae. Any pupae that are
                        to develop into the next stage, i.e. adulthood,
                        should have been handled by 'juv_emergence'.
                        IMPORTANT: this should update 'juv.dt' on a
                        global scale.
juv_to_adult            Takes a juvenile agent and splits it into adult
                        ages This is to simulate 'emergence' of
                        juveniles form aquatic stage. Many variables
                        stay the same, like motherID, but new ones are
                        added or changed Agents also undergo one
                        motility event when they emerge. This becomes
                        their new lat/long.
produce_eggs            Determines which mothers are ready to lay eggs
                        and calls 'initialise_eggs'. Conditions to be
                        satisfied for a mother to lay a clutch of eggs:
                        1. Has a mate 2. Enzyme Kinetic Score > 1 and
                        gonoCycle = 0 OR 3. EKS > 1.58 and gonoCycle =
                        1 OR 4. EKS > 2.16 and gonoCycle = 2.
random_dispersal        Random dispersal of a single agent according to
                        distance formulae.
temperature_chart       Calculates the average daily temperature over
                        the simulation period. Temperature calculations
                        are in Celcius.
update_enzyme           Gets the amount by which the Enzyme Kinetic
                        Score for an agent will increase. This value is
                        added to their current EKS. This function works
                        as a 'lookup' for the EKS data, which is all
                        calculated at the beginning of the simulation-
                        this function just grabs it
update_juv_stage        Updates the development stage of juvenile
                        agents.
